The goal of poRtfolio is to create an application to keep track of an
investment portfolio across multiple platforms, pensions, or just a
collection of savings accounts, and see how they’ve developed over time.

In first instance it will require initial input from the user. Perhaps
there is a potential to start using APIs for common providers.

I’m intending to include comparisons against markers such as inflation,
or perhaps certain scenarios such as, what if I had invested in S&P 500
instead if x fund/saving account
