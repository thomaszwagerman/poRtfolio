The goal of poRtfolio is to create an application to keep track of an investment portfolio across multiple platforms, pensions, or just a collection of savings accounts, and see how they've developed over time. 

In first instance it will require initial input from the user. Perhaps there is a potential to start using APIs for common providers.

I'm intending to include comparisons against markers such as inflation, or perhaps certain scenarios such as, what if I had invested in S&P 500 instead if x fund/saving account
